use hash table to find if there are any duplicates
the countMap[num] accesses the value associated with the key 'num', which we access from the vector

if it is there, it returns a reference to the corresponding value

just to note,if key/value is set to type int, the value is initialized to 0 

so with the line duplicated[num]++, were taking the value and incrementing it by 1
as soon as we encounter a key(generated through num) with an assosciated pair that is more that 1, we have a duplicate!
